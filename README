Building and using Slap
=======================

On all systems Slap needs Python 2.5 (or better) installed to build and run. 
Once Slap is built (see below):
1. Place all media files under the media directory in the Slap directory
2. Execute slap.py

Slap is built with a Python script called build.py. It is written such that errors are Python exceptions. If you encounter an exception when running build.py, then the build failed and it's probably not a bug in the script.

Building Slap on *nix
=====================

In the Slap directory execute build.py. If all goes well, the 'build' directory should now contain a fully formed Slap setup that you can run and copy to your USB stick.

Building Slap on Windows
========================

Building Slap on Windows requires:

1. SWIG 1.3.31 or better (http://www.swig.org)
2. Microsoft Visual C++ Express or better (http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/)
3. Microsoft Platform SDK (http://www.microsoft.com)

Once the above are installed, you need to set a few environment variables:

1. PYTHON_INCLUDE (e.g. c:\python25\Include)
2. PYTHON_LIB (e.g. c:\python25\libs\python25.lib)
3. SWIG_BIN (e.g. c:\Program Files\swigwin-1.3.31)

You also need to have a properly setup Visual Studio environment. The easiest way to do this is to use the Visual Studio command prompt (e.g. Start menu->All Programs->Visual C++ Studio Express Edition->Visual Studio Tools->Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt). In the command prompt cd to the Slap directory and execute build.py.

If all goes well, the build directory should now contain a fully formed Slap setup that you can run and copy to your USB stick.

Windows build notes
===================

mpg123 will compile with ~720 warnings on Windows - that's a lot of warnings. Fixing all these warnings would probably require extensive changes in the mpg123 code itself. I've tried to keep changes here to a minimum. 

SWIG also appears to raise a couple warnings in its generated code.

Miscellaneous
=============

Slap is built out of various bits and pieces:

mpg123 (http://mpg123.de) - to play mp3 (version 0.66)
mutagen (http://www.sacredchao.net/quodlibet) - to parse media meta-information
Python (http://www.python.org) - some Python curses script used in the Windows curses emulation (wcurses)
